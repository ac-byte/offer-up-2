Add comprehensive Gotcha card behavior requirements and iterative processing

- Added Requirements 21-26 covering detailed Gotcha card behaviors:
  * Gotcha Once effects (buyer selects 1 card to steal/discard)
  * Gotcha Twice effects (buyer selects 2 cards independently)
  * Gotcha Bad effects (point loss and transfer mechanics)
  * Gotcha effects on buyer's own sets (must discard, can't steal)
  * Buyer role continuity (money bag vs actual buyer role)
  * Iterative Gotcha processing (continue until no sets remain)
  * Gotcha processing order (Bad → Twice → Once)

- Renumbered all subsequent requirements (former 12-20 became 27-36)

- Added 19 new properties (42-60) covering all Gotcha behaviors in design.md

- Updated total property count from 61 to 80 properties

- Updated tasks.md with new implementation tasks and property tests

- All documents maintain consistent requirement/property traceability

This ensures comprehensive coverage of complex Gotcha card mechanics with
deterministic processing order to reduce edge cases and manual effort.

Fix action phase infinite loop by implementing pass system

- Replace response round system with cleaner pass-based logic
- Track actionPhasePassesRemaining and actionPhasePlayersWithActionCards
- Reset pass counter when action cards are played
- Decrement counter when players pass
- End phase when no players have action cards OR passes remaining reaches 0
- Update GameState interface to use new pass system fields
- Rewrite action phase handlers (PLAY_ACTION_CARD, DECLARE_DONE)
- Replace handleActionPhasePlayerDone with handleActionPhasePlayerPass
- Remove all response round functions and logic
- Update all 21 action phase tests to use new pass system
- All 250 tests passing, TypeScript compilation successful

Fixes the infinite loop bug where action phase would never end
as long as any player had action cards. The new system properly
tracks passes from eligible players and terminates when all
have passed or no action cards remain.

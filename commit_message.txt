Update requirements and design docs for action phase pass system

- Replace Requirement 8 "Action Phase Response Rounds" with "Action Phase Pass System"
- Update all 5 acceptance criteria to describe pass-based logic:
  * Count players with action cards at phase start
  * Reset pass counter when action cards are played
  * Decrement counter when players pass
  * Auto-skip players without action cards
  * End phase when no action cards remain OR pass counter reaches zero

- Update GameState interface in design doc to include:
  * actionPhasePassesRemaining: number
  * actionPhasePlayersWithActionCards: number[]
  * autoFollowPerspective: boolean

- Rewrite Properties 27-31 for new pass system:
  * Property 27: Pass system initialization
  * Property 28: Pass counter reset on action card play
  * Property 29: Pass counter decrement on player pass
  * Property 30: Automatic skipping without affecting pass counter
  * Property 31: Action phase termination conditions

- Renumber all subsequent properties (32-61) and update property count from 58 to 61
- Update tasks.md to reflect completed task 8.2 and new property numbers
- Mark task 8.2 as completed with pass system description

Documentation now accurately reflects the implemented pass system that
fixes the infinite loop bug while maintaining comprehensive property coverage.
